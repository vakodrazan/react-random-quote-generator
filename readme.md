As long as you fulfill all the user stories, you can give your personal touches by adding transition, using your own images, changing colors, or even creating your own layout,...

Once you completed, submit your solutions by providing URLs for both GitHub repository and live app on Netlify and explain briefly what you have done.

-   What have you learned/improved?
-   Your wisdom? :)

### Guidance

 - You can find my demo in [githbub](https://github.com/vakodrazan/react-random-quote-generator)
 - I experienced quite lots of thing.
    - First of all, I learn how to reuse the function that I use to fetch the data from API. And reuse it when clicking the random button to get the next random quote.
    - Secondly, I experienced that we can use a property from the api in the link by accessing it we need to `useParams`.
    - Lastly, we can go to the list of quotes that written by one author by clicking the author link. That works because I use link by installing `npm install --save react-router-dom`
 - I learnt so much about how to acess link in react and how to go to another page when clicking a link.
